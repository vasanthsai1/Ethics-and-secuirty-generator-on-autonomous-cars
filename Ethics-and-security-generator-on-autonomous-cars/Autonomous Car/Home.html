    <h1>Airtificial Intelligence</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field within computer science that aims to create machines capable of mimicking human cognitive functions such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. AI is categorized into Narrow AI, specialized in specific tasks, and the theoretical Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), capable of generalizing across domains. Employing techniques from machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing, AI has diverse applications including automated customer service, healthcare, finance, and autonomous transportation. As AI continues to evolve, it raises ethical and societal concerns like job displacement and data privacy, necessitating responsible development and governance.</p>
    
    <h1>Autonomous Cars</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Autonomous cars, commonly known as self-driving cars, are vehicles that use advanced algorithms, sensors, and computational abilities to travel from one point to another without the need for human intervention. They combine radar, LIDAR, camera, GPS, and infrared sensors to scan and interpret their surroundings and navigate roads. With the potential to revolutionize transportation, reduce congestion, and decrease accidents, these vehicles represent a transformative frontier in automotive technology.</p>
    
    <h3>Ethics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Decision making during emergencies: How should a car prioritize safety?</li>
        <li>Data privacy: Who owns and can access the data generated?</li>
        <li>Employment: What happens to traditional driving jobs?</li>
        <li>Accountability: Who is responsible in case of an accident?</li>
        <li>Accessibility: Ensuring all individuals can benefit from this technology.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="security">Security</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cybersecurity: Protecting against potential hacks and unauthorized access.</li>
        <li>Data integrity: Ensuring data used for driving decisions is accurate and hasn't been tampered with.</li>
        <li>Secure communication: Making sure that communication between vehicles and infrastructure is encrypted and secure.</li>
        <li>Physical security: Safeguarding onboard systems and sensors against vandalism.</li>
        <li>Regular software updates: Ensuring the vehicle's software is regularly updated to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>
